# Discord Bot Project

## Overview

I conceptualized and deployed a Discord bot project without any coding experience, thanks to the powerful capabilities of A.I. This bot enhances server interactions by providing unique functionalities, showcasing the potential of non-coders to contribute to the development community.

## Project Development

Despite lacking coding skills, I leveraged A.I. to guide me through the process of creating and deploying this Discord bot. By generating code snippets and instructions, I transformed ideas into a functional bot that adds value to the server environment.

## Description

This solution was born out of a desire to share music with my friends.

The Discord Bot "WavWizard" joins the active voice channel and plays the audio file "wizard.wav" which is located on my PC.



## Learnings

Working on this Discord bot project taught me the potential of AI-powered assistance in bringing creative ideas to fruition, even without coding expertise.
